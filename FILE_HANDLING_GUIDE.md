# 📁 RTX Toolkit Bot v3 - Comprehensive File Handling

## ✅ **YES! ZIP, TXT, and ALL File Types are Handled with State Management!**

Your RTX Toolkit Bot v3 now has **professional state-managed file handling** that supports:

## 🎯 **State-Based File Processing**

### 📤 **File Upload States:**
- `UserState.SESSION_UPLOAD` - Session files (.session, .zip, .tdata, .json)
- `UserState.FILE_UPLOAD` - Number files (.txt, .zip, .csv)  
- `UserState.WITHDRAW_PROCESSING` - Files during withdraw processing
- `UserState.IDLE` - Smart file detection and routing

## 📁 **Supported File Types**

### 🔐 **Session Files (in SESSION_UPLOAD state):**
- ✅ `.session` - Telethon session files
- ✅ `.zip` - Compressed session archives  
- ✅ `.tdata` - Telegram Desktop data
- ✅ `.json` - Session data exports

### 📱 **Number Files (in FILE_UPLOAD state):**

## 🧠 **Smart File Detection**

When users upload files in `IDLE` state, the bot automatically:

### 🔍 **Session File Detection:**
```
User uploads "my_session.session" in IDLE state
→ Bot detects session file type
→ Shows: "Session File Detected - Upload as session?"
→ Offers session upload button
```

### 📱 **Number File Detection:**
```
User uploads "numbers.txt" in IDLE state  
→ Bot scans for phone numbers
→ Shows: "Found 150 numbers - What to do?"
→ Offers: Check Frozen | Process Withdraw
```

## 🚀 **State-Based File Workflows**

### 1. **Session Upload Workflow:**
```
User: Clicks "🔐 Upload Session"
Bot: Sets state to SESSION_UPLOAD
User: Uploads .session/.zip/.tdata file
Bot: Routes to _handle_session_file()
Bot: Processes based on file type
Bot: Stores in database, clears state
```

### 2. **Bulk Number Check Workflow:**
```
User: Clicks "📁 Bulk Check" 
Bot: Sets state to FILE_UPLOAD
User: Uploads .txt/.zip/.csv file
Bot: Routes to _handle_number_file()
Bot: Extracts numbers, stores context
Bot: Shows processing options
```

### 3. **Withdraw Processing Workflow:**
```
User: Clicks "💰 Process Withdraw"
Bot: Sets state to WITHDRAW_PROCESSING  
User: Uploads file or sends text
Bot: Routes to _handle_withdraw_file()
Bot: Accumulates numbers from multiple sources
Bot: Processes all collected numbers
```

## 📦 **ZIP File Processing**

### 🔐 **ZIP Session Processing:**
```python
async def _process_zip_session(self, zip_path, user_id):
    # Extracts session files from ZIP archives
    # Supports .session, .tdata, .json inside ZIP
    # Returns first valid session file found
```

### 📱 **ZIP Number Processing:**
```python  
async def _extract_numbers_from_zip(self, file, user_id):
    # Processes all .txt/.csv files in ZIP
    # Extracts phone numbers from each file
    # Combines and deduplicates results
    # Returns unified number list
```
