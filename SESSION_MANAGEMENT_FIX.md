# Session Management Fix - August 27, 2025

## Issue Fixed
- **Callback Error**: Users clicking "🗑️ Remove Session" button received "🔄 Unknown action. Please try again." error
- **Missing Handler**: The `remove_session` callback was defined in the UI but not handled in the callback router

## Changes Made

### 1. Callback Handler Updates (`handlers/callback_handler.py`)
- ✅ Added `remove_session` callback routing
- ✅ Added `confirm_remove_session` callback routing  
- ✅ Implemented `_handle_remove_session()` method with confirmation dialog
- ✅ Implemented `_confirm_remove_session()` method for actual deletion

### 2. Database Manager Updates (`core/database.py`)
- ✅ Added `get_user_session()` method to retrieve session information
- ✅ Added `remove_user_session()` method to safely delete sessions
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging for session operations

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- ✅ **Warning Dialog**: Users see clear warning about session removal consequences
- ✅ **Confirmation Required**: Two-step process prevents accidental deletions
- ✅ **Success Feedback**: Clear confirmation when session is removed
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages if removal fails
- ✅ **Next Steps**: Guidance on how to upload new session after removal

## How It Works Now

1. **User clicks "🗑️ Remove Session"**
   - Bot checks if user has a session
   - If no session: Shows "No Session Found" message
   - If has session: Shows warning dialog with consequences

2. **User confirms removal**
   - Bot safely removes session from database  
   - Shows success confirmation
   - Provides options to upload new session or return to menu

3. **Error handling**
   - If removal fails, shows error message
   - Offers retry option
   - Logs error details for debugging

## Security & Data Protection
- ✅ **Soft Delete**: Sessions marked as inactive rather than hard deleted
- ✅ **User Verification**: Only session owner can remove their session
- ✅ **Complete Cleanup**: Session data completely wiped from active use
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: All session operations logged for security

## Testing Status
- ✅ Callback routing verified
- ✅ Database methods tested
- ✅ Error handling validated
- ✅ User flow confirmed

The "Unknown action" error for session removal is now completely resolved! 🎯
